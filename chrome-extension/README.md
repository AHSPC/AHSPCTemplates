# Chrome Extension Starter Template

### Files
- `manifest.json` - info about your extension - fill in the `<FILL THIS IN>`s
- `popup.html` - what you see when your extension is clicked
- `popup.js` - the content script - it can access things on the current page
- `background.js` - the background script - used to talk to the chrome API and do stuff in the background
- make files called `icon-48.png` and `icon-128.png` for 48x48 and 128x128 px icons and put them in the same folder as the other files above


### Notes
- This enables "webNavigation", "activeTab", and "scripting", which are the most commonly used permissions
- Your app may need more permissions - web search for what the string is for the permission you need and add it - ask on discord if you need help!
- You can find information about the chrome APIs online
