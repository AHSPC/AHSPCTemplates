# Discord bot in Python

- Make sure you have python installed (ask in the discord if you need help), then run:

```
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U py-cord

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U py-cord
```

- Get a discord bot token (search for "how to create a discord bot and get token" online)
- put it where it says [TOKEN HERE] in `bot.py`
